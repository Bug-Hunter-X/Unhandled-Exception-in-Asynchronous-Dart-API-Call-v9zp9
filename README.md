# Unhandled Exception in Asynchronous Dart API Call

This repository demonstrates a common error in asynchronous Dart code: improper exception handling in an API call. The `fetchData` function makes an HTTP request to an API.  If the request fails (due to network issues, server errors, etc.), it throws an exception.  However, the current exception handling is minimalâ€”it merely prints an error message and rethrows the exception. This leaves the calling code vulnerable and may lead to application crashes or unexpected behavior.

## How to Reproduce

1. Clone this repository.
2. Run `fetchData()` from `bug.dart`. If the API is unavailable, the exception will be printed but not fully handled.

## Solution

The `bugSolution.dart` file provides a more robust solution.  It includes:

* **More informative error messages:**  Provides context to the user.
* **Retry mechanism:** Attempts to retry the request after a delay in case of temporary network issues.
* **Proper error handling:** Catches specific exceptions and handles them appropriately.
* **Clearer separation of concerns:** Isolates error handling from core logic.

This example highlights the importance of comprehensive error handling in asynchronous operations to build robust and reliable Dart applications.
